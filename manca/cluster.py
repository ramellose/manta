"""
The clustering algorithm works in several steps. First, an empty adjacency matrix is instantiated.
Then, the following steps are carried out until sparsity has stabilized:

1. Choose a random node i and select k-neighbours for k in diffusion range
2. For each node b in k-neighbours, multiply 1 by the edge weight of edge (i, b) and the value generated from (i, k-1)
3. Perform K-Means clustering on the resulting diffusion score matrix
4. Calculate sparsity of clusters;
            positively weighted edges between clusters add 1 to the sparsity value
            negatively weighted edges between clusters subtract 1 of the sparsity value
5. Sparsity lower than previous sparsity? --> continue iterating
   Sparsity equal to previous sparsity? --> iterate until convergence limit is reached

The number of iterations and the generated matrix is then supplied to the centrality function.
The centrality of an edge is calculated by the value of an edge in the matrix.
Hence, this does not imply that an edge had a large effect on other edges;
rather, it implies that it was affected by many of the diffusion processes during the iterations.

These centrality scores are then tested for their robustness using the functions in bootstrap_centrality.
As the absolute value of the scores is irrelevant,
only the ID of the edge (negative or positive hub) and the p-value is returned.
