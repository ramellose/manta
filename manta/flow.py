"""
Cluster assignment by manta makes use of a scoring matrix.
Functions in this module can generate such a scoring matrix.

First, an empty adjacency matrix is instantiated.
Then, the following steps are carried out until an error threshold is reached:

1. Raise the matrix to power 2
2. Normalize matrix by absolute maximum value
3. Add 1 / value for each value in matrix
4. Normalize matrix by absolute maximum value
5. Calculate error by subtracting previous matrix from current matrix

If a network consists of clusters connected by positive edges,
it will frequently fail to reach the error threshold.
This can happen because of two reasons: firstly, the scoring matrix enters a flip-flop state.
Secondly, the matrix converges to zero.
Flip-flop states are detected by comparing the error to the error 2 iterations ago.
If this error is 99% identical, manta continues clustering with a partial iteration strategy.
Zero convergence is detected when the threshold of the 99th percentile
is below 0.00000001.
In either of these cases, manta proceeds with a partial iteration strategy.
This strategy repeats the same steps as the normal network flow strategy,
but does so on a subset of the network.
The scoring matrix is then recovered from stable edges;
stable edges are defined as edges that have only positive or negative values during a minimum fraction of permutations.
Those permutations are summed together to give positions in the scoring matrix.

def diffusion(graph, iterations, limit, verbose, norm=True, inflation=True):
    """
    Diffusion process for generation of scoring matrix.
    The implementation of this process is similar
    to the MCL algorithm. However, the rescaling step
    in the MCL algorithm has been adjusted to accomodate
    for negative signs.
    In the first step, the matrix is scaled;
    afterwards, every value in the matrix has 1 divided by the value added.
    Subsequently, the matrix is scaled. The
    cumulative error, relative to the previous iteration,
    is calculated by taking the mean of the difference.

    If a memory effect is detected, not the outcome matrix but the first iteration is returned.
    Additionally, 5 iterations after the flip-flop state has been reached are calculated.

    Normally, memory effects should not be detected because these only happen
    if the graph is unbalanced.
    The Harary algorithm is used to check whether graphs are unbalanced.
    If they are, this diffusion process should not be run.
